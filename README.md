This is work in progress. CPU emulation works, PPU is under development.

## NES emulator project

This is implementation of NES (Nintendo Entertainment System). The purpose of this repository is to test some Rust concepts and to practice a bit Rust programming language.

There is still plenty of work that needs to be done (finish PPU, implement APU support). Also it is written in rather suboptimal way with focus on making things work.
